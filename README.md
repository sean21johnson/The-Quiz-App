This is our Quiz App which is a triva challenge about NBC's The Office. In this app, we utilized jQuery to travers and manipulate the DOM. The index.HTML file is bare-bones and template generation functions within the Javascript are used instead. Event handlers are used to determine how a user progresses through the quiz as it listens for mouse clicks and form submissions.
